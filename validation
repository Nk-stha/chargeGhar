Admin Advertisement Response & Validation Guide
This document defines the standard Success and Error response structures, and maps every validation rule to its specific error message.

1. Response Structures
Standard Success Response (HTTP 200/201)
All API endpoints return a standardized JSON envelope.

{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Operation successful",
  "data": {
    // ... endpoint specific data ...
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-03-20T10:00:00Z"
}
Standard Error Response (HTTP 400/404/500)
Validation errors will return HTTP 400 with a detailed errors object (if the backend uses standard DRF formatting) or a simple message.

{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "errors": {
    "field_name": ["Specific error message"]
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-03-20T10:00:00Z"
}
